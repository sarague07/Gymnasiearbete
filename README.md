This game is a demo to a bigger game, i used only unitys built in 3d graphics and sound aswell as soundeffects came from the website freesounds.org

In this game you spawn as a player who wants to break through the matrix, and break through reality by remembering, collecting capsules and killing enemies who wants to trick you and make you forget by reseting everything and getting you stuck in this infinite loop. There are two ways or endings of this game, the red or the blue way. The red wat makes the player a bit faster and enemies faster as well, since they are fighting to make you forget and start over, it ends with the player spawning in a black room where they fall for eternity with a text saying Congrats! you remembered. The blue way does everything to make the player start over, everything is now red, confusing the player since red means heal & good and blue means bad. At the end of the level the player will see a blue wall, and when they walk through the wall they teleport into a void where a text fills the screen "forget forget forget..." over and over again.
